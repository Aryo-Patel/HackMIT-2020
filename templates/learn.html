                <h2>Open</h2>
                <p>The opening price is the first price that a security trades for when an exchange opens for the day. This price is typically not the same as the previous day's closing price due to orders that accumulated after-hours on the previous night, some of which will not be executed until the market opens on the next business day. Several day-trading strategies are based on this principle.</p>

                <p>Range refers to the difference between the low and high prices for a security over a day. A large range suggests price volatility, which is a good indicator of a security's risk. Those with low risk tolerances will often opt to purchase securities with a lower range, such as stocks found in the stabler sectors like utilities, healthcare, and telecommunications.</p>

Usually, stocks with higher ADTV are less volatile because much larger trades would have to be made to affect the price. Higher ADTV is also an indicator of the security’s overall liquidity.</p>

This value is found by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current value of each share, this makes it a real-time estimate of the company’s value. Higher market cap ($10 billion or more) indicates that a company is typically well established and less risky.</p>

                <h2>Beta 3 Year Monthly</h2>
                <p>Beta is the monthly price change of a particular company relative to the monthly price change of the S&P 500 over a time period of 3 years. Beta is an indicator of a security’s market risk or volatility relative to stocks in general. A beta greater than 1 indicates volatility greater than the S&P 500. Typically, many new technology companies have this level of beta. Conversely, a beta of one or lower indicates that a stock’s price is steadier than most stocks. Understanding beta can help an investor choose the securities that match their level of risk-tolerance.</p>

                <h2>Price to Earnings Ratio</h2>
                <p>The P/E represents the amount of money an investor can expect to have to invest in order to receive one dollar of the company’s earnings. This value is determined by dividing the current stock price by the earnings per share. A high P/E value can mean that a stock’s price is high relative to earnings and thus the stock may be overvalued, or that high growth rates may be expected in the future.</p>

The ratio of these distributed funds relative to its stock price is the dividend yield, and this indicates how much the company will pay out in dividends. A forward dividend yield predicts the percentage of a company’s current stock price to be paid out as dividends over a given time period, which is generally 12 months.</p>

This date is typically set two business days before the record date. Investors typically want to buy stock before the ex-dividend day, but because the stock will usually decline in price on the ex-dividend date, those who miss the deadline buy the stock at a discounted price by buying on the ex-dividend date</p>

                <p>The target estimate is the value that various analysts believe a stock will be priced after a year. It is important to note that while analysts perform careful and detailed analysis to arrive at the target estimate, the price is only a calculated guess. However, these estimates often affect how investors interact with a stock, which can significantly impact the price of a security. Therefore, this value can help traders determine when they want to buy or sell a stock.</p>
